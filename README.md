# Project-2-Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts
Data Exploration of Hacker News dataset -- Kaggle 

The project explores the dataset from the Kaggle competition: hacker News Posts, to run exploratory analysis on which posts recieve more comments and to see if posts created at a certain time recieve more comments

For this analysis, I will 2 different kinds of posts on Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts I'll explore begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.

Quick context here - Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "Which is the best online course for python?". Similarly, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

I'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?

Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Like any data science project, we begin by reading the dataset
